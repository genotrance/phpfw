============================

Enhancements
------------
- Modules can now register errors and SQL queries which can then be invoked
  using the Error::display_error() and the Sql::*_query() functions respectively.
  This is done with the Module::register_error() and Module::register_query()
  functions in the module's constructor.
- Similarly, module exceptions can be registered using Module::register_exception().
- Added Login::update_login() to update the user's login in the user table.
- Added Login::change_password() to update the user's password in the user table.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed bug in Login.php where Login::check_login() was calling Login::login_user_form()
  instead of Login::login_user().
- Fixed bug in Module::exec_module_action() where the executed action was operating on
  a new instance of the executed module instead of the one instantiated by the controller.
  Issue only occurs under PHP 4.

Enhancements
------------
- Added support for DATE columns. Form element is an input text box with javascript
  checking to ensure input is in mm-dd-yyyy format.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed bug in Database::check_schema() where tables were being processed in a
  sequential order instead of first processing DATA tables and then LINK tables
  since LINK tables depend on DATA tables being identified.
  
- Fixed bug in Database::check_schema() where LINK table checking was hard coding
  primary key names.
  
- Fixed Email.php where header had an incorrect 'From' address format.

============================

Enhancements
------------
- Added method Table::get_table_rows_with_actions(). Method returns data obtained from 
  Table::get_table_rows() and appends an additional 'Actions' field to provide 'view', 
  'update' and 'delete' links. 

- Moved application name and session lifetime configuration elements from index.php
  to config.ini. Changes to Application::Application() and 
  Application::check_configuration_file() as needed. 

- Added isset_and_non_empty() global function to check that variables loaded from the
  configuration file are set and are not empty strings. Used in phpfw.php and Login.php.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed bug where if templating framework was left blank in config file then Phpfw 
  complained that framework '' was invalid.
  
- Fixed bug where DATE_ADDED and DATE_UPDATED fields were not being ignored in the form
  processing function.
  
- Fixed a bug in Login.php where 'check_login()' was not loading the login configuration.
